## Setup Accounts

You will need a couple accounts to perform the exercises. They're very easy to setup:

1.  [**Github**](https://github.com/) for collaborating with versioned code repositories and use to serve websites.
2.  [**Google**](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en) to contribute towards notes in Google Docs and use Google Sheets. You don't need a gmail account and can even use your existing email to setup a Google account.

## Install Software

This training will require the following software installed on your machine:

1. [**Webex**](https://www.webex.com/downloads.html) for connecting to the live webinar.
1. [**R**](https://cran.r-project.org) scientific programming language
1. [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) integrated development environment
1. [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/) version control

Please download the appropriate stable release for your operating system. I highly recommend getting the latest versions for all the features.
