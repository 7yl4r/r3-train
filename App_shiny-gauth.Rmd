- You'll need to change from http://127.0.0.1:7445/ to http://localhost:7445, otherwise you'll get:

  ```
  Authorization Error
  Error 400: invalid_request
  Permission denied to generate login hint for target domain.
  ```

- You'll need to run the app on a specific port using `shiny::runApp(port=7445)`, otherwise you'll get something like:

  ```
  Authorization Error
  Error 400: redirect_uri_mismatch
  The JavaScript origin in the request, http://localhost:5779, does not match the ones authorized for the OAuth client. Visit https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient/${your_client_id}?project=${your_project_number} to update the authorized JavaScript origins.
  ```
